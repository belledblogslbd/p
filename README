SYNOPSIS:
    This is a simple function for managing virtualenvs. It is similar to
    virtualenvwrapper but with fewer features. Use it to activate, deactivate,
    and switch virtualenvs.

    Currently there are two hooks provided:
         post-activate and post-deactivate.
    These should be files placed in the bin directory of your virtualenv

    p.sh is meant to be sourced and not run directly.

REQUIRES:
    bash
    PYENV to be set to your base dir for virtualenvs

PROVIDES:
    p

INSTALL:
    put into ~/.bashrc or the like:
        export PYENV=~/my_virtual_envs
        source /path/to/p.sh

USAGE:
    p --help
    p -d  - deactivate current virtualenv
    p ENV - switch to ENV, running the post-deactivate hook for any current
            virtualenv, and running the post-activate hook for ENV. Tab
            completion is supported.
    p .   - cd to site-packages
    p ..  - cd to virtualenv root

SYNOPSIS:
    A couple of python/virtualenv utilities.

    p is a simple function for managing virtualenvs. It is similar to
    virtualenvwrapper but with fewer features. Use it to activate, deactivate,
    and switch virtualenvs.

    Currently there are two (shell) hooks provided:
        * post-activate
        * post-deactivate.
    These should be files placed in the bin directory of your virtualenv

    p.sh is meant to be sourced and not run directly.

    pystrap is a utility for fine grained control over python and virtualenv,
    or for use with old or awful unixes without nice repositories. It:
        * downloads and compiles python from source
        * installs python in your user directory
        * downloads virtualenv and dependencies
        * creates virtualenvs using these

    It only requires bash, and everything is kept in ~/.python.

REQUIRES:
    bash
    p requires PYENV to be set to your base dir for virtualenvs

PROVIDES:
    p
    pystrap

INSTALL:
    p:
        put into ~/.bashrc or the like:
            export PYENV=~/my_virtual_envs
            source /path/to/p.sh

    pytstrap:
        put it somewhere in $PATH

USAGE:
    p --help
    p -d  - deactivate current virtualenv
    p ENV - switch to ENV, running the post-deactivate hook for any current
            virtualenv, and running the post-activate hook for ENV. Tab
            completion is supported.
    p .   - cd to site-packages
    p ..  - cd to virtualenv root

    pystrap -h --help
    pystrap        - install python2 and virtualenv
    pystrap ENV    - create virtualenv ENV with python2
    pystrap -3     - install python3 and virtualenv
    pystrap -3 ENV - create virtualenv ENV with python3
